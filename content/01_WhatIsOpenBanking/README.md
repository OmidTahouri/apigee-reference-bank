# What is Open Banking?

Open Banking describes the ability for customers to share their data with third
parties, that have obtained consent, using APIs.

Evolution of Banking 
---
- *1658* Thomas Smith Opens the UKs first provincial bank branch in Nottingham
- *1983* Bank of Scotland set up the *Homelink* home online banking system
- *1984* Girobank introduces a dedicated Telephone banking service
- *1999* PayBox launch Mobile Banking
- *?* Cars that pay for their own petrol
- *?* Houses that pay for their own utilities
- *?* Disco lights that flash on payday

> Who owns the customer experience in each case?

__In future, banks will no longer own the customer experience.__

What is a good developer experience?  --- A developer has an idea for an app.
They open the banks developer portal.

- In 5 seconds, the developer should know what an API does
- In 5 minutes, the developer should have make a successful request
- In 5 days, the developer should have taken their app to production

If they cannot use your APIs, they will look elsewhere.

Relevant Legislation 
---

- In the UK, it is typical to stay with one or two banks for your entire life.
  In general you will select a bank as a child and may only consider switching
  when buying a house or other major life event. This is in contrast to mobile
  phone contracts, where roughly every 18 months you have a trigger to look for
  a better deal.
- Additionally, there are limited options in the UK. When Metro Bank obtained
  their banking license in 2010, it was the first high-street banking license
  issued in over 150 years.

## CMA Competitions and Markets Authority investigated the following three
questions:
- Is there a weak customer response due to lack of engagement or barrier to
  switch and search?
- Are there barriers to entry and expansion for banks?
- Is the level of concentration of banks having an adverse effect?

## Remedies
- Nine Largest Retail Banks in the UK to adopt an Open Banking Standard
- Customer prompts to encourage consideration of switching providers
- "Customers who are satisfied about privacy and security safeguards, and are
  willing to give consent, will be able to share their own transaction data with
  trusted intermediaries, which can then offer advice tailored to the individual
  customer" (section 168)
- "Open APIs are central to our package of remedies" (section 169)

## PSD2
- Second Revision of the Payment Services Directive in the EU.
- Aimed to “increase competition in an already competitive payments industry,
  bring into scope new types of payment services, enhance customer protection
  and security”
- All EU Member States must implement the directive by 13 January 2018 (ish..?)

## PSD2 Detail 
Looks to better support two new types of payment service that have entered the market:
- Payment Initiation Services
- Account Information Services The directive requires that Account/Payment
  Service Providers expose certain data through Open APIs to be consumed by
  AISPs and PISPs In order to establish trust between all parties, a central
  registry may be created with all AISPs, PISPs and PSPs registered.

## Worldwide

We are now seeing a growth in Open Banking regulation around the world. Examples
of Open Banking APIs can be found in USA, Jordan, Mongolia, India and Australia.

---

Standards 
---
The two most popular standards within Europe are:
- Open Banking Implementation Entity
	- Initially funded by the 9 biggest banks in the UK
	- More opinionated specifications
	- Redirect-based authentication only
- Berlin Group
	- Formed of ~40 Banks across the Single Euro Payments Area
	- Greater flexibility in payload structure 
	- Redirect, decoupled and embedded authentication supported

Propsed Use Cases 
---
- Current Account Comparison Services
- Personal Finance Management
- Affordability Check
- Online Accounting
- Fraud Detection
- Switch Service Demo 
- Smart Home Integration? Disco lights on payday?
- Smart Car Integration? Automated fuel payments? 

---

Beyond Compliance 
---
Whilst initially, banks have been rushing to meet compliance deadlines, many see APIs as a new channel. Three common questions are: 
- How do we attract developers?
- How can we monetize our API program?
- Can we leverage other banks APIs to provide a better customer experience?
- How can we stand out with innovative APIs?

Trusting Third Parties
---

In order to give a third party access to our APIs, they must register their App. For simple APIs, this is performed in a Developer Portal, however for Open Banking it is more common to allow registration via API so that third parties can register with many banks in one go. We call API-based approach "Dynamic Registration".

## Contributing Guidelines and Philsophy

Summary of the Philosophy of this Project:
- The aim of this project is to act as a reference implementation
	- Code should be as simple and reusable as possible. Ideally shared flows with no more than 4 policies
	- Edge cases should be described using the Apigee Community, not this repository
	- All content should have a corresponding User Guide in the _content_ directory
- Cost of maintenance
	- Low cost of maintenance is the best way to keep a codebase up to date
	- Where possible, API Specifications and Tests should be derived from original sources (e.g. Berlin Group, OBIE)
	- Duplicating Apigee Documentation or Community Discussions is bad. By copying it here, screenshots will go out of date, best practices will further mature and content will generally become stale. Please just link to the original source!
